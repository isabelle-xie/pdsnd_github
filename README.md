**Bikeshire Project**

### Description
In this project, we made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States â€” _Chicago_, _New York City_, and _Washington_. It allows users to import the data and provides answers to their questions about the database by computing descriptive statistics. It also allows users to see raw input via an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.
